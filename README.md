# 42-piscene
Bootcamp assignments for several weeks 

Grades are attached below, I missed several days as well

Something noteworth was I missed BSQ due to a small issue printing out newlines to stderror instead of stdout so that the output was not properly redirected. The diff was only one new line.
I got 100% on the functional tests. 

```basic_tests: Two parameters KO | functional_tests: OK```
